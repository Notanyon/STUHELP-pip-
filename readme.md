## Description

It can be used for coding practicals, cheating and much more as it provides you feature to find mean, mode, median, average and sort any array. We all have seen students suffering to learn things like numpy and using it so why don't I help? I present you my creation STUHELP, you can find any answer of any data question in seconds. So forget numpy and say hello to STUHELP.

## How to use : 

To use this program is another thing. It might be hard for some begginers but if you will review the whole code in my github repositry you can easily understand it working as I used begginers components only to write this program. 

To use sort in program you can use a syntax like this :

## Python packages used : 

So in this code only 3 pip packages are used which are respectively :
1. time(sleep was imported specifically)
2. os(cls was imported specifically)
3. numpy(array, median, mode, mean, average specifically)
